## Getting Started with the Graded Response Model

### An introduction and tutorial in R

In this tutorial paper, we aim to familiarize applied psychology researchers to the graded response model, a family of Item Response Theory (IRT) model, specifically designed to estimate measurement precision for polytomous ordinal (Likert) scales.

We keep all the materials related to the tutorial paper in this repository.
